## Parallels Desktop: Miscellanea by [`unshare`](https://github.com/unshare)

Initially, this repository was all about patches for Parallels Tools for Linux.  
It looks like Parallels don't have enough engineering resources to keep up with mainline kernels
and fast-moving distributions.  
Passing the patches through Customer Support doesn't work, I've tried. Sad, but true.

Besides having to carry my patches, I had to set up an integrated development environment of sorts.  
It happens to be Visual Studio Code and it should be run on the Linux side.  
(Using _Remote - SSH_ extension should absolutely be considered.)

The bits by Parallels are commited as `Parallels <noreply@parallels.com>`.  
If someone from Parallels ever bumps into this repository and finds anything of use,
I hereby waive any copyright claim for that occasion.  
Just keep maintaining the product, please.

In my opinion, I am allowed to publish this derivative work.

[Parallels EULA](https://web.archive.org/web/20210526135703/https://www.parallels.com/about/legal/eula/)
Exhibit A Article 1d reading:
> Parallels Tools is a suite of utilities and drivers that enhances the performance and
> functionality of Parallels virtual machine. You may distribute and install Parallels Tools to
> enhance performance and functionality of Parallels virtual machines.

Same EULA, Article 2.1 (abridged):
> You shall not, directly or indirectly, or permit any end user or other third party to: ...  
> (b) modify, translate, adapt, or create derivative works of the Software, Documentation, or any
> license keys that you have obtained in any way (except to the extent applicable laws specifically
> prohibit such restriction for interoperability purposes, in which case you agree to first contact
> Parallels and provide Parallels an opportunity to create such changes as are needed for
> interoperability purposes); ...

In reality, I do enhance functionality of my own Parallels virtual machines and this EULA does not
prohibit sharing my stuff to enhance functionality of third parties' Parallels virtual machines.  
And I did try to first contact Parallels through Customer Service (ticket #2961939) with no
satisfactory result.  
Yet, I'm not going to defend this statement and will unpublish everything as soon as the first
seize-and-desist letter hits my inbox.

Full disclosure: I'm an ex-Odin and ex-Virtuozzo employee.  
It's no longer my dog food, but some habits do die hard.
